 - Compile Time Errors 
  - Multiple error messages does not mean multiple errors 
  - Check for syntax errors, by reading the code and error message carefully 
  - Debug step by step, compile each piece of code at a time 
- Run Time Errors 
   - Test Infinite loops with print messages 
   - Test Infinitie recursion with print message and check for base case (StackOverflowError)
   - The exception errors are pretty self explanatory 
- Logic Errors 
  - Only you know what the program is supposed to do 
  - Use variables to make code clearer 
    - Don't just use large number expressions without knowing what each part represents
  - Go for a walk 
- Don't be afraid to ask others for help 
  - Be clear with your problem and how you got there 
  - Explain problem to duckie
- Take time to understand the bugs, and what your program is supposed to do
