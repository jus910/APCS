time spent: 1 hrs

DISCO
- There is no solution for a 2x2 or 3x3 chess board.
- When we render a possible branch useless, we can "undo" our last move using removeQueen() and go to the next possibility.

QCC
- Why is there no solution only for the 2x2 or 3x3 board?
- How can we display ALL solutions for a given chess board?
