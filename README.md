#### Do Now
* Load Piazza
* Load Java Visualizer
* Update local work repo

#### Tasks of the Day 
* We reviewed the feedback given to us for Loopier.java 
* We worked on array-1 and array-2 on codingBat for the rest of the period

#### Homework
HW37: PPMP[]
* Fetch KtS.
* Using 2 clicks or fewer, load codingbat in your browser.
* Login.
* Open your code editor and a terminal session, so that you can compose each method and test in your own environment before pasting into the website. (This will also help grow a collection of useful little methods to add to your growing repository of code. PROTIP: Copy the problem description from the site into your editor as the descriptive comment for each method, and copy the given test cases into your main method…)
* Peruse the Array-1 and Array-2 sections. Form a plan. Do as many as possible, starting with the simplest.
HW36: All Quacked Up
* Procure KtS.
* Summon duckie. Optionally, also a nice cup of hot tea…
* Load Appendix D of ThinkJava and commence to reading.

#### Next LCT:
