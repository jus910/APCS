* DISCO
* - Values outside of the bounds (a and b) aren't checked for a potential swap
*
* QCC
* - Why return a value for mysterion()?
*
* q0: What does it do?
* a0: Partitions an int array into two subarrays.
*     Elements to the left of splitIndex are less than splitValue.
*     Elements to the right of splitIndex are greater than splitValue.
*     Adjusts the splitValue to the index that satisfies the above.
*
* q1: O(?)
* a1: O(n) (assuming loBound and hiBound are 0 and n?)
