time spent: 0.5 hrs

DISCO:
- an array is known to be sorted if there is only one element in the array.

QCC:
- What makes merge sort more efficient compared to other sorts?

THINKER FIRMWARE:
- Only thinkeren with cards are allowed to speak. They may only speak to <3 other thinkeren.
- When a thinker has >1 card, split the deck in half and give both to two other thinkeren. Then hold up your hands!
- If a thinker's hands are empty, receive a split deck from another thinker.
- If a thinker has 1 card, it is declared sorted. Return the card to the thinker who originally gave it to you.
- Upon receiving back 2 decks of cards, look at the first card of each deck and sort them accordingly into one new deck. Repeat until the new deck is sorted.
