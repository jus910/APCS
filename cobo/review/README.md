### Experience
- We thought the lab itself was relatively straightforward. We appreciated the fact that the tasks were sequential. That is, the earlier tasks we did made it earlier to finsih later tasks.
- We did think it was a little bit tedious to have to create a new .txt file for each review to be processed.
- We found making the boundaries for the star ratings was a bit strange. With the way totalSentiment() is written, wouldn't it mean that mean a long, positive review would have a greater star rating than a shorter, more concise positive review?
