q0: From any starting position, an open tour can't always be found. In a 5x5 grid, with a starting position of 
    [0][1], no solution can be found, and therefore no tour (open or closed) can be found.

q1: From any starting position, a closed tour can't always be found. In a 5x5 grid, with a starting position of 
    [0][1], no solution can be found, and therefore no tour (open or closed) can be found.

q2: Each time n increases by 1, the amount of squares on the board increases by 2n-1. With each extra square 
    on the board, the maximum execution time increases exponentially. Due to this, as n increases the average 
    execution time increases significantly (ex. 3.047s average time for 5x5 grid, and 99.812s for 6x6 grid)

q3: Could be optimized by targeting the corners first, since they have the least viable knights moves.

Cleanest algo in "2D" style: 
-From starting position, move up/right/down/left
-If movement not possible, try next move
-If no movements possible, go back to last movement and try next move
-If movement goes to exit, finish.
