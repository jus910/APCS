time spent: 0.2 hr + class time
*/

/*
DISCO:
- On the Java API it is stated that doubly linked lists implement the Deque and List interfaces
  - Given this fact we will not use doubly linked lists to make the Deque class
QCC:
- If a deque is a two sided queue, then would it render the one sided queue obsolete?
