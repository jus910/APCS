HW82: Roll Your Own Iterator
2022-03-27
time spent: 0.5hr + class time

Disco:
 - WU TANG CLAN
 - The iterator works like a pointer, that points to the next value
 - With the way we coded it, the pointer _dummy is on the current element
    - This means that the "next" methods use the current value _dummy is on not the next one
    - When we tried to use the next value of _dummy in hasNext() the loop would either leave out the last or first element

 QCC:
 - What is the point of _okToRemove?
    - Our code could work without using it
